* Atmel microcontroller tests
- Multiple sensor data acquisition using TWI
* TODOs
** TODO BUGFIX MAJOR Calibration routine falters when a single sensor is calibrated
- This is bad because if unexpected sensors are calibrated, they will not necessarily have the pumps in the correct direction 
- Two possible explanations
  - Calibration =mark= not being reset in microcontroller O2 code
  - Microcontroller is not clearing the serial recieve buffer, leading to stale data being read again 
** TODO FEATURE MEDIUM Manual powering ON/OFF for o2 sensors
- This is not supported in o2: add a flag (perhaps by just generalizing =cal_mark=) that indicates that a sensor has been manually turned off
- Also need to add relevant code in calibrate.py to handle this
** TODO BUGFIX MEDIUM Client needs to actually timeout
- Client currently does not timeout while reading serial data, only if it gets 0 datapoints
  - This behavior was specific to certain issues with the pressure sensors
- Client should timeout when reading data from device
  - Check for a pyserial feature that returns something on tiemout
** TODO FEATURE MINOR Try/catch blocks for calibrate
- Calibrate needs to do its thing forever: catch errors and continue
